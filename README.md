# 🛒 Unsupervised Learning for Retail Insights  

This project applies **unsupervised learning** techniques to uncover hidden patterns in customer purchasing behavior using **market basket analysis**. By leveraging **Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms**, we extract **frequent itemsets** and **association rules** from an online retail dataset, providing valuable insights into consumer habits and cross-country purchasing trends.

## 🚀 Project Overview  
Retailers collect vast amounts of transaction data, but without the right techniques, these data points remain underutilized. This project demonstrates how **association rule mining**, a core **unsupervised learning** method, can be used to:  
- Identify **frequent product combinations** purchased together.  
- Extract **high-confidence association rules** to inform marketing strategies.  
- Compare the efficiency of **Apriori vs. FP-Growth** in mining patterns.  
- Perform **cross-country analysis** (France & Germany) to identify market-specific trends.  
- Visualize support vs. confidence to interpret the strength of discovered rules.
